# Dark Age

This is the theme I developed for myself, as I tend to work late at night and prefer dark themes, so I figured I'd go ahead and share it should it be desired. I am updating this pretty regularly, and intend to organize and comment everything so it is more easily adaptable should something not work for you!

Another method is using the [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) Chrome Extension to override the page css.

Thanks!
