# Dark Age

This is the theme I developed for myself, as I tend to work late at night and prefer dark themes, so I figured I'd go ahead and share it should it be desired.


# Instructions for Installation

## Option #1:
[Copy the CSS from here!](https://github.com/shodty/Roam_Dark_Age/blob/master/Dark_Age_of_Roam.css) and paste it into your roam/css page.

## Option #2:
Another method is using the [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) Chrome Extension to override the page css. If you are using that method, [copy the CSS from here](https://github.com/shodty/Roam_Dark_Age/blob/master/STYLUS/Roam_Dark_Age.css) and paste it into Stylus, and set it up to apply to Roam Research urls.

# Variables for Customization

Both options allow for customizing colors by changing the color values included at the top of the file. I did my best to comment everything with what exactly it will shift.
